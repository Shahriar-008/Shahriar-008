# Hi, Iâ€™m Shahriar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend engineer and DevOps & security enthusiast who loves building reliable systems with Python. When I'm not writing code I enjoy reading and keeping aquarium fish.

## About me
- ðŸ”­ I build backend services, design CI/CD pipelines, and work on infra-as-code.
- ðŸŒ± Deepening knowledge in cloud security, observability, and platform reliability.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and secure CI practices.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I read a lot and I keep aquarium fish â€” great way to relax after debugging deployments.

## Skills
- Languages: Python (primary), Bash
- Backend: FastAPI, Flask, Django
- DevOps / Infra: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, systemd, nginx
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- Security: Secrets management, least-privilege IAM, basic threat modeling, automated security checks
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, structured logging, tracing basics

## What Iâ€™m currently working on
- Improving deployment safety and recovery workflows for a microservices platform.
- Automating compliance checks in CI to catch security regressions earlier.

## How to reach me
- GitHub: @Shahriar-008
- I prefer collaboration via issues and pull requests â€” I review and respond there.
